# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

WTWR is written in React and JSX through Vite. In it, a weather API is called, returning weather, time, and location information. The temperature is used to determine what clothing should be worn. Other weather information is used to display the current weather. Time and location information are used to show, well, what the location is, and if it is day or night.

WTWR is also responsive, with the ideal desktop width being 1440px and the ideal mobile width being 375px.

In the second part of this project, I have added the ability to switch temperature scales, added a new page via React Router, and added functionality to add and delete clothing items to a mock server (and the page itself). I also added some form validation and made everything responsive.

In the third part of the project, WTWR now connects to the se_project_express server. In addition, users can log in and out, register, add clothing items, like clothing items, delete clothing items, and edit their profiles.

Currently weather information is hardcoded to the 11229 zip code.

My ranges of comfort with temperature are typically different that other people, so the ranges for clothing may be uncomfortable for others.

The ranges are:

- Hot: >= 65째 F
- Warm: 40째 - 64째 F
- Cold < 40째 F
